                            <p>Where is Word Cosmos available?</p>
                            <p><br />Word Cosmos is currently out for beta release, which means the current version of the game available for download has been built for us to identify which features work and don&rsquo;t with our players. This beta release is globally available for free on both iOS and Android devices. To play the game,</p>
                            <p>What are the age limits for Word Cosmos?</p>
                            <p>Under our Terms of Service, Word Cosmos players must be at least 13 years of age. Although we strive to keep all of our game content friendly for players of all ages, there are multiple reasons for responsible developers to apply a minimum age of 13. One of the reasons is the fact that we publish ads that might be unfitting for players under 13. Other reasons include the availability of in-app purchases and data privacy.</p>
                            <p>Privacy and Processing of Personal Data</p>
                            <p>Username<br />Our players are asked to create a username during the game&rsquo;s tutorial. Player usernames cannot be changed after confirmation. We recommend players to select a username not directly identifiable to them in real life to protect their security and privacy.</p>
                            <p>Location<br />The game automatically detects and sets a player&rsquo;s location during the tutorial. We collect this information to rank players on our Leaderboard and identify how we can keep the game engaging for players in certain locations.</p>
                            <p>Payment Information<br />We do not store any credit card information players provide us when making in-app purchases. Payment transactions are completed through Apple&rsquo;s App Store or Google Play, depending on your device.</p>
                            <p>How can I report an issue?</p>
                            <p>If you encounter a bad question in the game, a report button will be available when you click on an item on the word list that appears after each match.</p>
                            <p>If you need to report any concern regarding your game experience, please send us an e-mail at support@frecre.com outlining your issue with relevant screenshots, transaction IDs, etc.</p>
                            <p>Is Word Cosmos free to play?</p>
                            <p>Word Cosmos is free to download, offering optional &ldquo;in-app purchases.&rdquo; In-app purchases are not required to play the game, but can be acquired to enhance certain gameplay elements. Word Cosmos in-app purchases vary in price, ranging from $0.99 to $59.99 (without taxes) in U.S. app stores, for example. In-app purchases are paid for with real money and are always clearly labeled as such. They are found &ldquo;in-game&rdquo;, meaning that the options to make a purchase are found within the game itself.</p>
                            <p>Can I manage or turn off in-app purchases?</p>
                            <p>As long as no payment method (e.g. credit card information) is added to your child&rsquo;s device, no in-app purchases can be made. Should you decide to make purchases for your child and for this reason add your payment information to the device, remember to adjust password protection settings, or disable in-app purchases entirely afterwards to avoid unauthorised purchases.</p>
                            <p>Are my bank details safe?</p>
                            <p><br />FreCre, Inc. does not process payments for in-app purchases, or have access to your credit card information. Payment transactions are processed through the App Store or Google Play (depending on your device) via the email address connected to that account. Transaction receipts are emailed to you by Apple or Google after each purchase. Sometimes, purchases may be bundled together if you've bought multiple items, and it might take a few days for you to receive the receipt. These post-purchase processes are subject to change by Apple or Google.</p>
                            <p>I paid for an in-app purchase that I didn&rsquo;t receive. What can I do?</p>
                            <p>When you purchase any Gold pack from our in-app purchase options, your additional Gold should be instantly credited to your account. However, in rare cases, it may take up to 48 hours for transactions to process through Apple or Google and then make it to your game. We recommend that you try restarting the app by fully closing and re-opening it. Sometimes a fresh connection to the servers can trigger the in-app currency to appear.</p>
                            <p>If it has been 48 hours and nothing has happened, please contact Apple or Google directly for more information.</p>
                            <p>My child accidentally made an in-app purchase. Can I get a refund?</p>
                            <p>Like most downloadable products, items bought in Word Cosmos (in-app purchases) are non-refundable. In rare cases, exceptions may be applied.</p>
                            <p>If the purchase was made on an Apple (iOS) device:</p>
                            <p>For purchases made on an iOS device, FreCre, Inc. is not able to handle refunds directly. Please visit Apple support and select the "Contact iTunes Store Support" link, then "Purchases, Billing and Redemption" and choose the option that fits you best.</p>
                            <p>If the purchase was made on a Google (Android) device:</p>
                            <p>Please send an e-mail to support@frecre.com or contact us directly through in-game support by going to Settings and tapping the "Contact Us" button. Please select the category that your concern falls into, and in your message please add the receipt of the purchase. The transaction ID (looks similar to this - GPA.1234-1234-1234-12345) at the bottom of the document must be visible. Receipts for transactions have been emailed to you by Google after each purchase.</p>
                            <p>Please note: Receipts for any transactions are emailed to you by Apple or Google soon after each purchase. However, purchases may be bundled together if you've bought multiple items and might take longer. These post-purchase processes are subject to change by Apple or Google.</p>
                            <p>Where can I find my purchase history?</p>
                            <p>To review your purchase history, please check the guides below:</p>

                            <p>If neither you nor anyone else who has access to your device have played Word Cosmos, but you have been billed for a purchase(s) made within the game, it is likely that your Apple or Google account was compromised.
